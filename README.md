In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. Here I improved customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupation, gender, and age groups. I analyzed most selling product categories, and products, which can help to plan inventory, and hence meet the demands to increase sales.
