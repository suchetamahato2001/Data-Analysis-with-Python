In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. Here, I improved customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupations, genders, and age groups. I analyzed the most selling product categories and products, which can help plan inventory and, hence, meet the demands to increase sales.
